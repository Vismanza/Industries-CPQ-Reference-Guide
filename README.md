# Industries CPQ Reference Guide

The goal of this repo is to provide a usable reference guide for configuring Industries CPQ.

## How is this different to the Process Library listing?

[Industries CPQ Process Listing](https://github.com/salesforce/CPQ-Product-Recommendation-Demo) is in a zip file and does not contain many sample configurations. This repo will be in a standard Salesforce project format and focus on being usable using command line tools.

## Create Issues!

If there are any known issues or areas would sample configurations are needed please create issues. This will be used to prioritise development work.

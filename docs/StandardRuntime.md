# Notes on Standard Runtime


The /vlocity folder includes the datapacks as extracted from the Summer 23 SFI package. There are some code changes to the datapacks (changing config of DataRaptors 
for meet Omnistudio Metadata naming requirements).

## Steps taken:

1. Data Packs downloaded and configured as per docs.
2. Data packs deployed into org (Omnistudio enabled version).
3. SF Metadata not deployed as new versions required for Standard Runtime (included in repo).
4. Updates to VIP, DR, Flex Card and OS done directly then exported using SFDX Metadata.

## What is configured

Order page (Quote and Opportunity not configured yet). Flex Cards (Omniscripts not refactored yet).

##Â Standard Runtime CPQ App:

Application: Indsutries_Standard_CPQ
Flexipage: Standard_CPQ_Order
